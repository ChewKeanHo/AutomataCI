Continuous improvements or integrations (CI) is a nerve system of a
software product production. Leaving the job blindly by outsourcing
to any proprietary 3rd-party CI service provider is a guaranteed
way for being threatened and extorted by any malicious suppliers.
As of year 2021 to 2023, many evidences show that the suppliers
vilely alter their pricing charges after the fact to the point of
legally extorting their customers and destroyed some useful
software entirely.

Therefore, AutomataCI counters such problem by facilitating CI
functions natively, making it locally available, decentralized,
and redistributable at git repository level. 3rd-party service
providers can only call AutomataCI just like how the developer
performs them locally. This de-risk the software owner by not
completely depending on the service provider, allowing him/her
to switch supplier easily. AutomataCI also facilitates
technology-specific automation customization, capable of
absorbing new changes easily across time. It only uses the
basic POSIX compliant Shell and PowerShell scripts.
