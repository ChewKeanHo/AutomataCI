[![AutomataCI](resources/icons/icon-1200x400.svg)](#automataci)

This repo is a project template repository equipped with the AutomataCI serving
as a development foundation for software production of the supported kinds. The
development was started since 2022 under the
[ZORALab's Monteur](https://github.com/zoralab/monteur) Project to secure a
software production from the imminent supply chain threat across the software
industry globally.




## Why It Matters
Some good reasons to use AutomataCI:

1. **Start off with a tested foundation with pinpoint accuracy** - don't have to
   start from scratch anymore and just focus on your product development.
2. **Steadily for continuous improvement** - version controlled and improve
   iteratively.
3. **Simple and scalable** - just one git and some changes; you get a decent
   repo ready to deploy.
4. **Nimble and Adaptable** - don't let your suppliers' dirty business tricks
   threatens you.
