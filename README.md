[![Holloway's Template](artworks/logo-1200x630.svg)](https://github.com/hollowaykeanho/Template)

This repo serves as a template for all (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's new project
repository. It setups and includes all necessary and easy-to-modify artworks,
README.md, LICENSE, and `.gitignore` files that are crucial for a git
repository.
