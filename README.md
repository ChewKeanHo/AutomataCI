# AutomataCI
[![AutomataCI](src/icons/icon-1200x400.svg)](#automataci)

This is a template git repository equipped with a native built-in
semi-autonomous CI tool known as `AutomataCI`. It allows one to run a full-force
CI jobs without solely relying on any 3rd-party service providers which makes
the project extremely vulenrable to supply chain threat at least starting from
year 2021-2023 era.




## Why It Matters

Some good business reasons why using AutomataCI:

1. **Starts off with a solid & tested foundation** - All the templates and
   CI jobs are tested and have default configured for immediate software
   development.
2. **Avoid being threatend by malicious suppliers** - CI it's a nerve system for
   your product; handle it in-house and natively rather than leaving it nakedly
   vulnerable for any kind 3rd-party extortions.
3. **Steadily improvable** - AutomataCI itself are designed to be adaptive to
   market changes, self-improvable, and cater to common use cases.
4. **Simple and scalable** - Only uses `POSIX` shell and `PowerShell` so it
   works natively without much external installation.

### Documentations & Specifications

Check out the PDF file inside
[`automataCI/docs/AutomataCI-Engineering-Specification.pdf`](automataCI/docs/AutomataCI-Engineering-Specification.pdf).

It's regularly updated from time-to-time between each releases.




## How To Use AutomataCI

The entire Git repository is a actually a template repository. Hence, you would
either have to `git clone` it or download a copy of the latest source codes from
the [Release](https://github.com/ChewKeanHo/AutomataCI/releases) section. Then,
execute the following steps to make sure everything is correct.



### Refresh The Git Hooks

Once unpacked, you will need to refresh the `git` hooks by deleting the hidden
`.git` directory at the root of the repository and then git init again. A POSIX
Shell command looks as follow:

```
$ rm -rf .git
$ git init --initial-branch=main
$ git remote add origin <YOUR REMOTE URL>
```



### Update Software License

By default, the presented product license (`LICENSE.txt`) is using the
AutomataCI license. The goal is to change and update it matching to your product
license.

You should also update all files inside `src/licenses` matching your own
project. The `src/licenses/LICENSE-EN.odt` file is a
[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) Writer file. Hence, you're free to
use other document generator product as long as it can produce
`src/licenses/LICENSE-EN.pdf` for later packaging distribution use.



### Update Logo

By default, the presented icons and banners are of AutomataCI inside
`src/icons/` directory generated from the materials in
`src/icons/principle-canvas` using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
design software. You're free to use other design software as long as it can
generate the required output artifacts.

Once you're done designing your product brand in `src/icons/principle-canvas`
directory, please generate an optimized and usable graphic artifacts as follow:

1. `src/icons/icon.svg` - generic and widely-compatible icon file used
   everywhere.
2. `src/icons/icon-48x48.png` - PNG 48x48 icon file used in Linux system's
   icon and shortcuts.
3. `src/icons/icon-128x128.png` - PNG 48x48 icon file used in Linux system's
   icon and shortcuts.
4. `src/icons/icon-1200x400.svg` - used in README.md or marketing promotion.



### Update `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`

If required, please update `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` with your appropriate legal
clauses.



### Update `CONFIG.toml`

By default, AutomataCI is deploying its own `CONFIG.toml` product data. You
should update it entirely matching your product.

#### Technological Selections

AutomataCI is capable of running multiple supported technologies in a
repository. For example, you can enable Python technology by defining the
`PROJECT_PYTHON` directory name (default is `srcPYTHON`) and Go technology by
defining the `PROJECT_GO` directory name (default is `srcGO`) at the same time.

Choose wisely as the multiple tech feature consideration was made solely for
those who wants to use dedicated tech for other purposes (e.g. `SCULLY` for
static documents generation).



### Update Selected Tech's CI Specific Job Recipes

The default source codes directory (`src[TECH]`) comes with their tech-specific
AutomataCI job recipes inside its `src[TECH]/.ci` directory. Feel free to
modify them matching your needs using your POSIX Shell and PowerShell knowledge.



### Update All Distribution Resource files

All the data resource files in `src/{docs,packages,publishers}` shall be
updated matching to your product needs. Their specifications are made available
in the `automataCI/AutomataCI-Engineering-Specification.pdf` documentation.



### Update GitHub Integration Configurations

While usually not required, you can update the GitHub integration files inside
`.github` directory. Notable files are:

1. `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATES/*` - issue templates.
2. `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/*` - pull request template.
3. `.github/workflows/*` - GitHub Actions workflow recipes.
4. `.github/FUNDING.yml` - GitHub Sponsor button (Refer [Spec](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository)).



### Update README.md

Lastly, please update this `README.md` file. Currently, it's written for
AutomataCI project. You can remove it and write a new one.



### Clean Up Unused Source Directories

AutomataCI supplied a large number of source directories by tech. Once you had
decided your tech, you may remove all the unused source directories
(`src[TECH]`) and clean up the repository.


### Git Commit Initial Setup

At this point, your repo is now ready. Feel free to git commit your
initialization (assuming you're using `main` as primary branch):

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -s
... WRITE YOUR COMMIT ...
$ git push -u origin main:main
$ git switch --orphan gh-pages
$ git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial Commit"
$ git push origin gh-pages:gh-pages
$ git checkout main
```
