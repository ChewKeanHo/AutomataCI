# Template Repository
[![Holloway's Template](resources/logos/logo-1200x630.svg)](https://github.com/hollowaykeanho/Template)

This repo serves as a template for all (Holloway) Chew, Kean Ho's new project
repository. It setups and includes all necessary and easy-to-modify artworks,
`README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `.gitignore` files that are crucial for a git
repository.

> WHAT TO UPDATE AFTER CLONING:
>
> 1. Start with `README.md` especially dealing with title + anything below.
> 2. Update the `resources/logos/principle-canvas` logo files and re-generate
>    all the output logos OR delete them entirely.
> 3. Add a `LICENSE.md` file with the appropriate license(s).
> 4. Add a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file with the appropriate legal clauses(s).
> 4. Delete this blockquote once completed.
